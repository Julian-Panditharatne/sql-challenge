# SQL-Challenge

This Challenge is divided into three parts: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis.

## Data Modeling

In this part, I inspected the CSV files, and then sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables using a tool called [QuickDBD](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/5831/assignments/79484?module_item_id=1251786#:~:text=a%20tool%20like-,QuickDBD,-Links%20to%20an).

## Data Engineering

For this part, .

## Data Analysis

For this part, I created views of the following:

1. The employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2. The first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3. The manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4. The department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. First name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6. Each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7. Each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. The frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
